<br><br><p><center><h1>History of computer </p></h1></center><div class="para">
<p>The computer was not invented by a single individual, but its development evolved over time through 
contributions from various innovators. Key figures include<b> Charles Babbage</b>, who conceptualized early mechanical
 computers in the 19th century, and Alan Turing, who laid foundational principles in the mid-20th century. 
The invention of the transistor in the late 1940s by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley revolutionized 
computing, leading to smaller and more powerful electronic devices. 
The modern computer as we know it emerged from advancements in hardware and software throughout the 20th century, 
driven by the work of many pioneers and teams worldwide.<br></p></div>

<b>Early Mechanical Calculators:</b> Devices like the abacus have been used for centuries for arithmetic calculations. In the 17th century, inventors like
 Blaise Pascal and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz created mechanical calculators.<br><br>

<b>Analytical Engine (1837):</b> 
Designed by Charles Babbage, the Analytical Engine is considered one of the earliest concepts of a mechanical general-purpose computer, although it
 was never completed during his lifetime.<br><br>

<b>First Electronic Computers:</b> 
In the mid-20th century, electronic computers began to emerge. The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), completed in 1945, 
is often regarded as one of the first electronic general-purpose computers.<br><br>

<b>Transistor Invention (1947):</b>
The invention of the transistor by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley 
in 1947 revolutionized electronics and paved the way for smaller, faster, and more reliable computers.<br><br>

<b>Microprocessor Era (Early 1970s):</b>
 The invention of the microprocessor in the early 1970s, such as the Intel 4004 
and 8008, led to the development of affordable and powerful personal computers
